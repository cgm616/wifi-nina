`wifi-nina`
========

This is a driver for the WiFi Nina-type SPI co-processors commonly used in the embedded world to give WiFi-capabilities to a less capable chip.

Since the original project [dflemstr/wifi-nina](https://github.com/dflemstr/wifi-nina) seems to have become unmaintained, I've picked up the project to bring it back up to speed with the state of Rust in embedded.
Thanks to those who contributed to the original repository.
